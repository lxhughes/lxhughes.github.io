	<p>I'm a frontend-focused web developer with five years of professional experience. I  specialize in web-based tools that empower users of all backgrounds and levels of technical expertise to easily work with complex data.</p>

	<p>As a data visualization developer at MassDOT, my passion is in quickly prototyping new data dashboards with fast and beautiful <strong>JavaScript</strong> frontend using <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>Highcharts</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong> and <strong>Bootstrap</strong>. My advanced <strong>SQL</strong> skills are essential in navigating vast and complex data warehouses. My challenge is always to balance the essentially human <strong>communication skills</strong> of finding a meaningful story in the data, and the technical skill of <strong>automation</strong> to reduce human work down the line.</p> 

	<p>In my five years as a full-stack software developer Millward Brown Digital, I wrote a fun, fresh, and relentlessly <strong>browser compatible</strong> frontend for market research surveys designed to reach all audiences from teenagers to senior citizens. Modern <strong>HTML5/CSS3</strong>, <strong>Javascript</strong> and <strong>jQuery</strong> features including drag and drop, animations, and <strong>mobile-optimized</strong> video gracefully downgraded to ensure usability on browsers ranging from the latest Chrome down to IE5, and phones ranging from the latest iPhone down to a 1990s-era Nokia. In addition to my work on the frontend, I was also responsible for start-to-finish <strong>full stack development</strong> of internal tools in <strong>PHP</strong>, including a survey editor that let users code questionnaires and a bidding system to gather and compare quotes from vendors. </p>
